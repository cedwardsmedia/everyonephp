The original code (and thus, pre-1.0 code, was originally developed as part of [_CNAM_](https://github.com/cedwardsmedia/cnam)). Due to the growing maturity of _CNAM_ and the lack of a reliable PHP class for EveryoneAPI, I decided to fork the original code into a stand-alone library that everyone can use, and continue to expand [_CNAM-CLI_](https://github.com/cedwardsmedia/cnam-cli) and [_webCNAM_](https://github.com/cedwardsmedia/webcnam) separately.\r\n\r\nIn order to use _EveryonePHP_, you must have an [EveryoneAPI account](https://www.everyoneapi.com/sign-up)  with [available funds](https://www.everyoneapi.com/pricing).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nI highly recommend using _Composer_ to install _EveryonePHP_ for your project. _Composer_ will allow you to automatically install the _GuzzleHttp_ library, which _EveryonePHP_ depends on.\r\n\r\n1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)\r\n2. `cd` to your project's directory\r\n3. Run `composer require cedwardsmedia/everyonephp`\r\n4. Build your amazing project!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nI have never been a great programmer. As such, I strived to make EveryonePHP as simple to use as possible and I'm always looking to simplify it even more. Let's build a basic EveryoneAPI client using EveryonePHP:\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Instantiate EveryonePHP as an Object\r\n```php\r\n// Instantiate EveryonePHP\r\n$api = new EveryonePHP();\r\n```\r\nCreating a new EveryonePHP object allows us to interact with the class.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Set EveryoneAPI Credentials\r\n```php\r\n// Set EveryoneAPI Credentials\r\n$api->sid = \"9e3cef42da225d42bd86feaa80ff47\";\r\n$api->token = \"65f3ef01462c62f7f4ce7d2156ceee\";\r\n```\r\nEveryonePHP needs these credentials in order to query EveryoneAPI. Otherwise, the query will fail. How you obtain and store these credentials is completely up to you, just be sure to set them for each instance of EveryonePHP before calling `query()`.\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Set EveryoneAPI Data Points\r\n```php\r\n// Set EveryoneAPI Data Points\r\n$data = array(\"name\", \"profile\", \"cnam\", \"gender\", \"image\", \"address\", \"location\", \"line_provider\", \"carrier\", \"carrier_o\", \"linetype\");\r\n```\r\nEach data point is optional and all data points are returned by default, unless otherwise specified. In the same way EveryoneAPI uses a comma separated list of identifiers, EveryonePHP uses a simple array to specify the data points you wish to retrieve. EveryonePHP passes these identifiers directly to EveryoneAPI so you will use the same identifiers here as you would in a cURL request.\r\n\r\nFor a full list of available Data Points, check the [EveryoneAPI Docs](https://www.everyoneapi.com/docs#data-points).\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Perform EveryoneAPI Query\r\n```php\r\n// Perform EveryoneAPI query\r\n$api->query($phone, $data);\r\n```\r\nOnly `$phone` is required for this function. The function performs the query against EveryoneAPI and stores the results in a stdClass object, in this example, `$api->results`.\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Print the Results\r\n```php\r\n// Print results\r\n\r\n// Print first name\r\necho $api->results->data->expanded_name->first;\r\n\r\n// Print last name\r\necho $api->results->data->expanded_name->last;\r\n\r\n// Print carrier name\r\necho $api->results->data->carrier->name;\r\n```\r\nEveryonePHP converts the JSON response from EveryoneAPI into a stdClass object. This allows us to access the entire response for our application. In the above example, we print the first name, last name, and carrier for the given phone number.\r\n\r\n### Optional: Error Checking\r\n```php\r\n// Check for Error\r\nif ($api->error) {               // If there's an error\r\n   echo \"Error: $api->error\";    // Print it out\r\n   exit(1);                      // Exit with status 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEveryonePHP will assign error messages, if one occurs, to `$api->error`. You can use this in an `if` statement, as shown above, to halt your application if something has gone wrong.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it!\r\n2.
